# `autofix_class` rubric (personas)

`autofix_class` describes the **intrinsic shape** of follow-up work — it is signal, **not an apply gate or permission**.

| `autofix_class` | Meaning                                                                                                                                       |
| --------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `gated_auto`    | A concrete change is proposed in `suggested_fix`. Callers may apply after their own judgment.                                                 |
| `manual`        | Actionable work that needs design input or a decision before code changes. Include `suggested_fix` when you can propose a defensible default. |
| `advisory`      | Report-only — learnings, residual risk, rollout notes.                                                                                        |

## Persona guidance

- Prefer `gated_auto` when you can write a defensible `suggested_fix` for a localized change.
- Use `manual` when the right fix depends on product intent, architecture, or cross-cutting refactors.
- Use `advisory` when nothing breaks if left unfixed but the observation has value.
- Do **not** emit `safe_auto` — callers decide what to apply; reviewers classify and propose.

## Owner field

| `owner`               | Meaning                                  |
| --------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| `downstream-resolver` | Caller or human should act after review. |
| `human`               | Judgment required before implementation. |
| `release`             | Operational / rollout follow-up.         |

Do not use `review-fixer`.
